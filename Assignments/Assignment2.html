Thus, it talks about how there should be some sort of space maintained between our joints, relationships, thoughts, and so on. For instance, in case, there is any sort of space reduced between our joints, then we do feel joints pain. Likewise, if there are any sorts of spaces reduced in between thoughts, then it can affect our mental health. Even in the relationship, there needs to be a certain level of space.</p>

			<section>
			<h2>Prithvi (Earth)</h2>
			<p class="sub_content">Prithvi represents solidness. The earth is rigid, heavy, and stable. It can hold something and stop something. When there is a lack of Prithvi, then your hairs might fall, teeth might become weak, bones might become brittle, the bleeding might not stop, relationships might be unstable.

However, if there is an increase of fire, then it can increase the burning of chest, dark urine with burning, anger, aggression, and others. In case there is a lack of fire, then it can reduce appetite, diabetes, lack of creativity and even the warmth of the relationship can reduce.</p>
